\frametitle{Backup slides}

  Sometimes, it is useful to add slides at the end of your presentation to
  refer to during audience questions.

  The best way to do this is to include the \verb|appendixnumberbeamer|
  package in your preamble and call \verb|\appendix| before your backup slides.

  \themename will automatically turn off slide numbering and progress bars for
  slides in the appendix.
